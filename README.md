# 47DAYS_RF_WIZARD

This summer i've decided to take up the challenge of understanding and working with radio waves and the supporting gadgets. This will help me solidify my understanding of the light and Lasers in particular. Here's the plan. 

- Starting with refreshing my understanding of the nature of waves by differential equations, understanding SHM in detail and drawing correlation between the different manifestation of SHM like in a mechanical, electromagnetic and optics. For this ill be taking the famous course offered by MIT "Waves 8.01". 

- Refreshing my memory on Electromagnetic theory with emphasis on static charge, moving charge, and all fields associated with it. this will prepare me to explore propagation.

- To not be completely engulfed by theory i'll be reading the "ARRL" book once again as i did so 4 years ago but forgotten and with improved understanding i think it should benefit me more. this book will offer practical side of the antenna's and propagation. 

- To understand the related circuitry associated with electronic radio gadgets i'll study once again "The Art of Electronics by Howard" as i did so 4 years ago. i think it will benefit me more. 

- I'll be implementing the theory i've learned along the way on practical applications by using a software defined radio (RTL SDR), creating antenna's with it, attempting to transmit and receive. this should solidify my understanding further. 

- I'll be posting daily about my findings and progress... this will be a 47 days challenge hashtag#47DAYS_RF_WIZARD (until the start of my last semester). this should serve as notes and spark potential discussions that i'm looking forward to having with such a diverse network. 

- I'll be relating all the acquired knowledge to light and specifically Lasers as i continue to work on it throughout this period for my final year project. 

Lastly i'd like to note that i've been preparing for this for the past 6 years. this is the whole reason i got involved in electronics, programming and ultimately Physics. I think i've seen enough to be able to comprehend the vast field that is RF and with the help of professors i'm more than confident that i can get this under my belt. i've always found RF the closest thing to magic. I have all my bits and bobs ready for learning its potions and spells.

You can find each days progress within specific folder in pdf form that can be viewed on github as well.
